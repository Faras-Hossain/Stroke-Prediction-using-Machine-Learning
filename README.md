# Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrences based on healthcare data. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to train a logistic regression model.

Features

Data Exploration: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand patterns.

Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data.

Model Training: Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance with accuracy and classification reports.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn
