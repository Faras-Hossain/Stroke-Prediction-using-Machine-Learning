# Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrences based on healthcare data. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to train a logistic regression model.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand patterns.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data.
- **Model Training**: Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with accuracy and classification reports.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
