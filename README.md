# Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrences based on healthcare data. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to train a logistic regression model.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand patterns.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data.
- **Model Training**: Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with accuracy and classification reports.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Faras-Hossain/stroke-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd stroke-prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis step-by-step:

```sh
jupyter notebook notebook45fbb1bbec.ipynb
```

To deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit:

```sh
python app.py  # For Flask
streamlit run app.py  # For Streamlit
```
